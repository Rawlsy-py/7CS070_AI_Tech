# 7CS070 - Concepts and Technologies of AI

Welcome to 7CS070 - Concepts and Technologies of AI! In this module, you will learn the fundamentals of artificial intelligence and how to create machine learning applications to tackle real-life problems. We will be focusing on two main concepts: regression and classification.

## Getting Started

If you're new to this module, start here! We recommend that you go through each module in order, following the weekly schedule.

## Module Materials

The module materials include:

- Reading assignments to help you understand the concepts and theories.
- Lectures or presentations to guide you through the main ideas and topics.
- Images to illustrate the concepts and make them easier to understand.
- Watching videos to show you how to use machine learning tools and techniques.
- Writing assignments to help you practice what you've learned.
- Discussion forums to ask questions, share ideas, and collaborate with your peers.
- Quizzes and tests to assess your understanding of the material.

All activities will be submitted digitally. Your primary modes of communication will be email, announcements, and discussion forums.

## File Structure

Here's the file structure for this module:
```
├── ASSIGNMENT
│   ├── Classification
│   │   └── Classification Assignment.ipynb
│   └── Regression
│       └── Regression Assignment.ipynb
├── Week 1
│   ├── Workshop 1.ipynb
│   └── Data.csv
├── Week 2
│   ├── Workshop 2.ipynb
│   └── Data.csv
├── Week 3
│   ├── Workshop 3.ipynb
│   └── Data.csv
└── README.md
```

### ASSIGNMENT

The `ASSIGNMENT` directory contains the assignments for this module. You'll find two subdirectories:

- `Classification`: Here, you'll find the Jupyter notebook and HTML file for the classification assignment.
- `Regression`: This directory contains the Jupyter notebook and HTML file for the regression assignment.

### Week X

The `Week X` directories contain the materials for each week of the module. Each week may include one or more of the following:

- `Workshop X.ipynb`: In this Jupyter notebook, you'll get hands-on practice with the tools and techniques covered in the module.
- `Data .csv`: This will contain the data used for the workshop.
