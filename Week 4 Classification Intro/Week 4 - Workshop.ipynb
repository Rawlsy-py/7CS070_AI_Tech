    "## Task\n",
    "For this week's workshop, you will explore different parameters for the algorithms you have been taught for Classification (Logistic Regression). Each algorithm has different parameters that you can add and tweak to improve the accuracy. Use the following link and add every parameter to your model functions:\n",

    "- Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Set each parameter to the default value (found in the documentation). Start modifying these values based on the descriptions given and write a short description in your own words as to why the accuracy did or did not change. It is up to you how many you want to try but pick at least three parameters. This will also help your portfolio submission as you are exploring ways of improving your model!\n",
    "\n",
    "Once finished, you should submit your file. If you have multiple Python program files, zip them up and submit as a single file. It would be useful to us if you could write a comment with your submission which questions you struggled on (if any) so we can provide feedback quicker.\n",

    "## Grading\n",
    "This assignment is not graded; however, you will receive feedback on your work that will help you develop knowledge and skills that you need in order to be successful in your assessments.\n",
